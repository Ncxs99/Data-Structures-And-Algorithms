# Description 

The `Array` class is a class we've implemented from scratch as a **personnal project** in order to understand arrays as abstract data type : That is, arrays are represented as a **data structure** and we coded some **set of operations** on that data structure. 

It provides **fundamental tool** designed to **facilitate array manipulation tasks within C++ programs**. It offers a variety of essential functionalities, ranging from basic operations like **array creation** and **element insertion** to more advanced tasks such as **finding and counting duplicates, merging two arrays or displaying missing elements in an array**.

It's worth noting that while the `Array` class covers **many common array manipulation algorithms**, it does not encompass every possible scenario. We have focused on implementing the **most important and widely-used algorithms** to provide a solid foundation for array as **abstract data types**, and how they are **currently implemented in modern programming language**. Feel free to give us feedbacks. It is very important for us in order to improve the quality of this github repo.

As a **student project**, the `Array` class serves as a **practical learning tool for understanding and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++**. By exploring its functionalities and examining its implementation, we can gain valuable insights into the principles of array manipulation and algorithm design.
