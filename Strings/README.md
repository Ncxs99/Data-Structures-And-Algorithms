The `String` class we've implemented provides some **simple algorithms to manipulate** strings . Our main goal is to see how strings are currently implemented in **modern programming languages** .

Although we may not implement all algorithms in detail, our current focus was on simple functions. Then, our class manipulates strings from simple operations like **return the length of the string** to more advanced features such as **permutation of a string, counting the number of vowels and consonents, comparing strings or finding duplicates inside them** . We will add up in the future more advanced features in our class . 

Our main goal is to sharpen our **understanding of data structures and algorithms**, especially strings in our case by provide some accessible, **step by step** guide on programming such **class in C++ programming language** . 

Last but not least, feedbacks are important for us . Do not hesistate to give yours by writing a comment in the `Issues` section of our github repository.
